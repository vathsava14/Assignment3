	<p align="justify">
	    &emsp; From the Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD), we can see that we have three different tables from which we fetch the data to our application from the <a href="https://data.ers.usda.gov/">USDA ERS</a> website, among the three tables the first table is called the State_Wise_Data and it has four columns namely State_Name which happens to be the primary key of the table. Apart from it there are three other columns in the table which are Total_Percentage, Urban_Percentage and Rural_Percentage which respectively represent the state wise average percentage of population over the age of 25 years and that had completed their education over the period of 4 years from 2015 to 2019, and the state wise average percentage of urban population above the age of 25 years that had completed their education over the period of 4 years from 2015 to 2019, and the state wise average percentage of rural population above the age of 25 years that had completed their education over the period of 4 years from 2015 to 2019.
	</p>
	<p align="justify">
	    &emsp; When coming to the other two tables Florida_Counties_Data and Ohio_Counties_Data have similar fields which are County_Name which happens to be the primary key for each of the table, and State_Name is the foreign key which is used for connecting both the Florida_Counties_Data and Ohio_Counties_Data tables to connect to the main table which is the State_Wise_Data table with the one to many relationship, and the last field in the tables are the Total_Percentage column which has the average percentage of the total population of the adults over 25 years of age in that county who had successfully completed their education over the period of 4 years from 2015 to 2019. Where each state in the main table can have multiple counties, but in the tables Ohio_Counties_Data and Florida_Counties_Data, each one will have one and only one state name which is the same for the entire table.
